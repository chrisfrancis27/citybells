				<h3>Events</h3>
	
				<p>The City Bells is an incredibly versatile group which can provide music to suit a range of occasions. Live music can add an extra sparkle to your corporate event, create a magical atmosphere at your wedding or be a memorable part of your party.
Having a saxophone quartet at your occasion has a number of benefits over other ensembles. The City Bells are perfect for outdoor parties/receptions, since the sound carries well, yet they can also play intimately in small indoor venues and saxophones don't require a PA system.</p>

				<p>If you would like a more upbeat touch to your celebration, The City Bells also work with many other bands and artists. Have a listen to the <em>'Small Band'</em> genre in our iPod for examples of our ever popular 'Mini Big Band'!</p>

				<cite id="eventsReview" style="display:none">"Having The City Bells play at our Silver Wedding Anniversary party really added that something special to the evening, creating a lovely ambiance and giving the guests something to talk about. We never knew that four saxophones could create such a full, beautiful and warm tone."</cite>

				<cite id="weddingReview" style="display:none">"Our wedding was a wonderful occasion in every way, but one of the most lasting memories both for us and our guests will be the music of The City Bells. We asked them to play for us at the beginning and end of the marriage ceremony, during the drinks reception which preceded the wedding breakfast and as our guests sat down for the wedding breakfast. The music was a blend of classical and soft jazz - a programme compiled by The City Bells and including, most memorably, an arrangement of Glenn Miller's "In the Mood" put together just for the occasion. It was not just the music that exceeded our wildest expectations. We were also impressed by their sheer professionalism. Once we had explained what we wanted, we simply left it entirely to them and, such was the confidence they gave us from our very first discussion, at no point did we have to worry about how it would be on the day. And with so many things to worry about when planning a wedding it is easy to understand what a relief this was. We would also mention their flexibility. The weather was, unexpectedly, so good that we moved the drinks reception outside to the garden terrace. The City Bells simply followed us and set up just by the opening onto the terrace so that all our guests could still share the joy of their music."</cite>

				<h3>Horn Sections</h3>
	
				<p>If you have an existing band which requires extra instruments, The City Bells acts as a group of talented session musicians for recordings and gigs. As well as the obvious saxophones, these multi-faceted players can also double on <em>flute</em>, <em>clarinet</em>, <em>oboe</em>, <em>bassoon</em>, <em>piano</em>, <em>drums</em>, <em>guitar</em>, <em>bass</em>, <em>viola</em> and <em>vocals</em>!
City Bells are available to hire for studio recording, live events and recording, and tours. Have a listen to some pieces from our <em>'Small Band'</em> genre in the iPod for examples of The City Bells' horn section work.</p>

				<p>Perhaps you already have synth horns in a track and would like to replace these with quality live instruments - The City Bells provides high quality, professional recordings to replace the original mix. You can even purchase The City Bells' original arrangements, orchestrations and compositions for your own horn section or quartet - just <a href="contact.php">email us</a>!</p>

				<cite id="hornsReview" style="display:none">"I can't thank you enough for organising such a fantastic band for our wedding. The music choice was perfect and everyone commented on how brilliant you all were. (I'm actually seriously considering organising a Christmas/new year party for the same group of family and friends every year! Will definitely be calling to book you!!!)"</cite>

				<h3>Workshops</h3>
	
				<p>Being that all members of The City Bells teach, together we can provide exciting and engaging workshops, demonstrations or masterclasses. Be they in schools, hospitals, care homes or for charity events, we are always keen to get involved in the educational side of music.  As multi-instrumentalists, we aim to demonstrate and inspire using a range of instruments and genres. We often include games and musical activities to involve audience participation.</p>
				
				<p>We also give motivational talks to upcoming performers and composers. Each workshop/masterclass differs as The City Bells caters to each audience according to their needs, and we try to expose new music where relevant. The City Bells will happily discuss workshop structure at length with the client to guarantee an energised, interactive, inspiring and memorable performance.</p>

				<cite id="workshopReview" style="display:none">"They worked the room and were very unique. They made a dramatic entry from off stage and had a powerful finale. A highly entertaining group of young, very talented musicians who performed to a thoroughly professional standard. Our audience enjoyed them very much."</cite>
